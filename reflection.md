What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For my case, it wasn't really hard to transfer imperative code to OOP because in CSC120, I loved working with class and objects. Also, I remember heavily focusing on refurnishing my code on the final project of CSC120 that everything came back pretty easily. The main problem that I had with this assignment was that I couldn't make the 'computer' class subscriptable, so I spent a lot of time figuring that out. Initially because I wanted to keep the classes seperate from each other as they're independent, I refused to import 'computer' on resale shop file, so I added parameters to resale's methods which made the code even more complex. Thus, during thursday class, I asked Professor Crouser regarding the problem and figured out I could just use one of class on the other one. After class, Tina and I spend the afternoon marking bugs and debugging. My advice would be to skim and go over past CSC materials and ask for help as it's available.
